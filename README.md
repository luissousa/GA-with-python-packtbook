My study of the book Hands-On Genectic Algorithms with python (https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-genetic-algorithms-with-python/9781838557744) from Pack in jupyter notebook form
The oficial git of the book: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Genetic-Algorithms-with-Python
##Introdutory
The files in this git was written using the Google Colaboratory a great tools, together the Jupyter Notebook, to study algorithms of a easy and a pratical way and very used to the data science people.

I´m starting to study this optmization tool, but the original git it´s using the py file and in the my study I write the algorithms in a esay way to see, study and debug
